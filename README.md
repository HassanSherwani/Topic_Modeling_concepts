# Topic_Modeling_concepts
Key concepts of topic modeling and their codes

# Dataset
Data collected on multiple powertrain technologies such as electric vehicle, hybrid electric vehicle, fuel cells vehicles and internal combusion engine(traditional vehicles) patent. We have made a text analysis on these technologies and performed topic modeling.

# What is topic modeling?

In machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents. Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body.
Topic models are also referred to as probabilistic topic models, which refers to statistical algorithms for discovering the latent semantic structures of an extensive text body. In the age of information, the amount of the written material we encounter each day is simply beyond our processing capacity. Topic models can help to organize and offer insights for us to understand large collections of unstructured text bodies.
